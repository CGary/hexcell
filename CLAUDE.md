# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

**HexCell Orchestrator**: a multi-cell (multi-tenant) orchestrator in Rust that deploys WhatsApp bots for micro-businesses on modest local hardware (10-year-old i7, 8 GB RAM).

**Language rule**: ALL repository content is in **Spanish** — docs, code identifiers, comments, and commit messages (conventional commits: `docs:`, `feat:`, etc., never with AI attribution). This file is the single deliberate exception, kept in English for instruction-following efficiency.

**Current state**: do not trust any hardcoded stage claim — check `docs/STATUS.md` and `git log` first. As of 2026-08-27, stages A-1 through A-4 are closed and A-5 (knowledge engine, Shadow DB) is in progress. Task artifacts are archived under `kitty-specs/hex-NNN/`; work branches follow `ai/<ID>` (Quorum tasks) and `feature/<short-description>` (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Commands

Rust workspace (eight crates):

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test -p <crate> <test_name>            # single test
cargo test --workspace -- --ignored rss_linea_base --nocapture  # RSS baseline (ignored test)
```

Go sidecar:

```bash
cd sidecar && go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./... -count=1
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) blocks on all of the above; the sidecar test suite must be non-empty.

## Documentary hierarchy (normative rank)

On contradiction, this order rules:

1. **`docs/PRD.md`** — normative source: requirements FR-01..FR-12, NFR-01..NFR-05, QA criteria.
2. **`README.md`** — operational/architecture detail the PRD doesn't cover (CLI, Phase B onboarding).
3. **`docs/plan/README.md`** — implementation plan index; one file per stage (`fase-a-N-*.md`, `fase-b-N-*.md`). Each stage declares which FR/NFR it covers.
4. **`docs/STATUS.md`** — living progress record (Definido / Pendiente). **Update it when a decision changes state.**
5. **`docs/adr/README.md`** — ADR table; its numbering is the source of truth, sequential, never reused or reordered. File format: `adr-NNNN-titulo.md`.
6. **`docs/bitacora-de-descartes.md`** — record of what was studied and **not** done, with the reason and reopening conditions. Not normative: it decides nothing, it leaves a trail. Numbering `D-NN`, sequential, never reused; entries are never edited or deleted, only marked `REABIERTO`.

## Architecture (the essentials to not break the design)

* **Two channels that coexist, not two sequential phases** (course set on 2026-07-28). The names "Fase A"/"Fase B" and the `fase-*.md` files remain, but their meaning changed:
  * **Fase A = own channel in production.** **whatsmeow** (Go sidecar, outbound websocket, no webhook/Caddy/inbound TLS) is the **default and permanent** channel, with real paying clients. `piloto-01` and `piloto-02` are the first two cells, not the total scope.
  * **Fase B = additional official channel** (Meta Cloud API + webhooks) that **coexists** with the own channel. Still frozen, but now activated by **demand from a client who justifies it**, not by client count or date.
  * **The third-client gate is REPEALED**, as is the rule "no commercialization on an unofficial channel". **Never write that Fase B replaces, substitutes, or closes Fase A, or that the sidecar is retired.** Growth is disciplined by the risk gates (hard portfolio ceiling and incident threshold that freezes sign-ups, stage A-7); their values are pending business decisions.
* **Channel port (`ChannelAdapter`, FR-12)** — the **coexistence** boundary: two adapters live at once in different cells. The Rust core never knows the WhatsApp transport; adding a channel = writing another adapter, not rewriting the product. Abstracted toward the most restrictive case (Cloud API), with this distinction: **the TYPE admits the restrictive result; each adapter's POLICY decides whether to produce it** — the own-channel adapter does not impose an artificial 24 h window. The simulated test adapter mimics the restrictive Cloud API semantics (24 h window, `FueraDeVentana`, `PlantillaRequerida`), not whatsmeow's. `sessions.db` never stores raw transport identifiers.
* **Cell** (`cell` in CLI/code): deployable unit per client. On the own channel = two containers (Rust core + Go sidecar) with shared local network and volume, IPC over a local socket, **with the sidecar as a permanent cost**; on the official channel = one container. Baseline budget: ≤ 80 MB RAM per cell on the own channel, < 50 MB on the official channel. **Neither figure is validated under sustained load**, and the per-server cell ceiling is unknown until measured (likely CPU- and I/O-bound, not memory-bound).
* **Dual SQLite persistence per cell**: `sessions.db` (hot read/write) + `knowledge_live.db` (read-only in production). Knowledge updates via Shadow DB (`knowledge_staging.db`) → immutable epochs (`knowledge_epoch_N.db`) with atomic switchover (symlink + `ArcSwap` + Graceful Drain).
* **GCRA over the port's normalized flow** (not over HTTP) for admission, and two-phase LLM financial accounting (prior reservation + exact reconciliation). LLM inference is 100% external (Gemini Flash/Groq/OpenRouter); local hardware never runs models.
* **Plan order**: nothing connects to a real channel until the consumer knows how to protect itself (admission and budget before pilots); backups are designed in A-2 and cover **four** databases (`sessions.db`, `knowledge_live.db`, the adapter identity store, and the sidecar's `sqlstore`) — a restore is only valid if the bot reconnects and responds, a criterion that requires the sidecar and a real channel and is therefore executed in A-3, not A-2.

## Workspace layout

* `crates/hexcell-core` — domain and channel port declaration, **zero external dependencies** (an acceptance criterion, verifiable with `cargo tree -p hexcell-core`).
* `crates/hexcell` — cell binary (engine, health endpoints, inference pipeline).
* `crates/hexcell-storage` — dual SQLite persistence (`rusqlite` 0.39 pinned; see the note in `Cargo.toml` before upgrading).
* `crates/hexcell-admin` — central CLI.
* `crates/hexcell-canal-simulado`, `hexcell-canal-contrato`, `hexcell-canal-whatsmeow` — simulated adapter, contract tests, whatsmeow adapter.
* `crates/hexcell-meta` — **empty and exposing nothing** until `adr-0013` is resolved.
* `sidecar/` — Go module hosting the whatsmeow session; talks to the core via versioned IPC (`docs/protocolo-ipc-nucleo-sidecar.md`).

## Practical rules

* Never version `*.db`, `*.db-wal`, `*.db-shm`, or `.env*` (already in `.gitignore`).
* The plan invents no requirements: every new stage or scope change must trace to an FR/NFR in the PRD or be recorded as a pending decision in STATUS.md.
* Open product decisions (monetization, user flows, commercial exceptions, Fase B public entry — `adr-0013`, hard portfolio ceiling, incident threshold) are treated as declared blockers, never resolved in passing. Do not invent client counts, cell counts, or prices the documentation doesn't fix.
* **The own channel's ban risk is structural**, not behavioral: Meta detects the library by its protocol fingerprint. It is documented as an expected event, not a failure; the highest-value measures reduce damage, not probability. Do not introduce bulk-sender folklore (jitter, "warm-up" protocols), nor proxies, VPNs, or IP rotation.
* A repealed decision is **superseded by a new ADR**; the old one is never rewritten and the numbering never reordered. Dates are always absolute (28 de julio de 2026 / 2026-07-28), never relative.
* **Before proposing a course change, shortcut, or new technique, consult `docs/bitacora-de-descartes.md`.** If the idea is already there, it is not re-debated from scratch: read its reason and reopening condition, and only reopen if that condition is met. Every new discard is logged in the bitácora **in the same commit that discards it**; a discard without a written reason is a lost discard.
